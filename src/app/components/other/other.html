            Welcome to the referendum based public chess session.</br>
            With this app you can play chess with strangers over the internet
            by voting which move should be made next on the board.</br>
            This app was made by Pavel Smirnov, student of Helsinki university,
            as part of a project assignment
            to implement an app with AngularJS/NodeJS frameworks in 10 days.</br>
            Also Twitch has nothing to do with this app. Just a reference to pokeymanz.</br></br>
